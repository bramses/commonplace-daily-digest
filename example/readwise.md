## At Home in the Universe: The Search for the Laws of Self-Organization and Complexity

{note}

> Immanuel Kant, writing more than two centuries ago, saw organisms as wholes. The whole existed by means of the parts; the parts existed both because of and in order to sustain the whole. This holism has been stripped of a natural role in biology, replaced with the image of the genome as the central directing agency that commands the molecular dance. Yet an autocatalytic set of molecules is perhaps the simplest image one can have of Kant’s holism. Catalytic closure ensures that the whole exists by means of the parts, and they are present both because of and in order to sustain the whole. Autocatalytic sets exhibit the emergent property of holism. If life began with collectively autocatalytic sets, they deserve awed respect, for the flowering of the biosphere rests on the creative power they unleashed on the globe—awed respect and wonder, but not mysticism.

> Biologists divide cells and organisms into the genotype (the genetic information) and the phenotype (the enzymes and other proteins, as well as the organs and morphology, that make up the body). With autocatalytic sets, there is no separation between genotype and phenotype. The system serves as its own genome. Nevertheless, the capacity to incorporate novel molecular species, and perhaps eliminate older molecular forms, promises to generate a population of self-reproducing chemical networks with different characteristics. Darwin tells us that such systems will evolve by natural selection.

## Tether hates terrorism, less concerned about human slavery

> And a [new report](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/a2t64MUfDupoEo9Y8Uw6FQ) from blockchain analysts Bitrace found that over $34 billion in USDT had flowed through sketchy OTC desks in the past 24 months, nearly one-fifth of which was related to money laundering, while another fifth was scam-related.

> Tether claimed that this “strategic transition has been meticulously planned,” but this not-at-all-rushed lineup shuffle failed to mention who might be taking Ardoino’s place as Tether’s CTO. Apparently this job is simple enough that Ardoino can wear both the CTO and CEO hats while also serving as CTO for Bitfinex *and* chief strategy officer for Holepunch (an encrypted platform for building peer-to-peer apps that launched in January). Perhaps this panoply of positions is why Tether never catches money launderers, drug dealers, and terrorists until someone else points them out.
